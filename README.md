# fMRI-EEG_preproc_QA_VUBrainHack

## INTRODUCTION
We are working on developing a QA pipeline for simultaneously collected fMRI-EEG data so that the user can determine whether the data is denoised and clean enough for further analyses. 

Preprocessing is a critical step in neuroimaging analysis, laying the foundation for accurate and meaningful scientific discoveries. We need help configuring a pipeline to quality check for multiple datasets. This project will allow attendees with or without experience handling fMRI/EEG data to get a chance to work with what we call the "raw data". Working on a QC pipeline includes devising visuals of what the data looks like at various stages to make sure that the preprocessing is working as you expected and the data collected is good quality for future analyses. Toolboxes used include AFNI, FSL, ANTs, chronux, etc.

## GOALS FOR THE BRAINHACK VANDERBILT
- Brainstorm different QA checks that will best represent what we are looking for in the data
- Learn more about the importance of various QA in fMRI and EEG data and how to best interpret our data
- Code an automatic pipeline to implement our QA checks and outputs an html or pdf of the figures/results

### Skills
Basics in MATLAB, bash, FSL, AFNI, EEGLab, and other processing toolboxes are helpful but not necessary. 
We welcome all stages in this project - from new to the field, to experts in preprocessing.

### Good first issues
1. issue one: organizing and deciding on best QA for both fMRI and EEG modalities 
2. issue two: experimenting with toolboxes to get various plots or figures for the QA step of interest 
3. issue three: develop an outline of a script that will output a clean, clear, and easy to use pdf or html of QA figures

### Participants will learn
- Learn how to read and interact with fMRI and EEG data from the raw unprocessed stage to the final analysis ready data
- Enhance their understanding of the most helpful toolboxes associated with neuroimaging and gain a foundational knowledge in using and implementing command line versions of their functions
- Learn how to develop and implement a pre-processing pipeline for both datatypes in MATLAB and/or bash
